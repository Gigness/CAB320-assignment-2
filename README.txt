Use of Pandas library
Discussed in the tutorial on 11th May and was allowed to be used. However in the following week's
tutorial on the 18th May it was determined that pandas was not installed on the labs computer. Therefore it was agreed
by Fredrick that pandas may be used on the pre-processing task with no penalty.
